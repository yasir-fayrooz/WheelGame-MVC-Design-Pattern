# WheelGame MVC Design Pattern


These projects were 2 assignments that were split up in order to help us understand the Model View Controller design pattern. The first assignment (Project "Wheel Game") consisted of mainly implementing the model and backend code while the second assignment consisted of implementing a GUI interface in a separate project that referenced the model from the first project to utilise the backend logic.
